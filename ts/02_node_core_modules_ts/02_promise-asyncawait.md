# FS Module - Promise & Async/Await (TypeScript)

This file contains 20 practical examples of using Node.js `fs/promises` module with both **Promise chaining** and **Async/Await**, written in **TypeScript**.

### üì¶ File Structure

### üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- All examples use `import * as fs from "fs/promises"`.
- Proper typings like `(): Promise<void>` and error types `catch(err: any)` used.
- Best practices for modular Node.js development with TypeScript.
